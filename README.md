I decided to create a website for the KPOP ITZY as i find that they are not being prometed enough. Then I added features like what to know about them. I also wanted the notice to be more world wide rather than just what is happening with them only.

## Design Process
As a user who likes to travel i wanted to know more about what events do itzy hold but the website doesnt provide it.
I wanted the website to be able to give more info so thats why i made changes to it

## assests
Html pages
    Index.html
    profile.html
    schedule.html
JS
    javascript.js
CSS
    normalize.css
    itzystyle.css

## Features
The drop down does a full screen menu

The logo can also be clicked to go back to the home page

The social media accounts is on all pages to promte the user to click on it

The notice section some of the text can be clicked to link to somewhere 

The home page everything can be clicked except background and the line divider

In the profile page the names on the left can be clicked to quick scroll to them.

## Features left to implement

- I wanted to implement the album page where they could see all their albums and when click on their albums u will be able to immediately see all their songs and be able to play and listen to their songs right on the spot instead of like going to youtube or spotify to go and find the song to play them. 
- I also wanted to implement the media screen but also again no time to do it all.

## Existing Featires
-Feature 1 - Almost all of the features stay on the same page exceopt the social media and the youtube buttons

I acutally wanted the videos to be on the same page but the videos couldnt be embedded.

## Testing
1. Going from Page to Page
    1. Go to the Notice page
    2. scroll to number 6 and click on it

2. Going to their social media accounts and shop
    1. go to any page of ur choice 
    2. click on any social media page that u wanna see
    3. **FOLLOW THEM NOW DON'T THINK**

For the website, when using other screen devices it doesnt really work only the home page but then only on some phones. the rest of it doesnt really work
I am trying to fix it but i dont think i have enough time.
A few problems is that i code until there is too many div that it doesnt really work sometimes.
